## In the node REPL mode (type node):

- to clear the console: cmd + k

- to show all available constructors/methods: double tab

- double tap can be done at many points:

- for example type `os.`, double tab to see all available methods.

- the underscore variable is a stand-in for the last in-memory in the REPL:

	- >4+4
	- >8
	- >_+4
	- >12

- To exit: ctrl + d

## General cool ES6 things:

	- Template Strings take away the need for separating strings and variables with quotes and adding operators.
	- For example:
	- ` const foo = "day"
		console.log(\`To${foo} is going to be a good ${foo}. Speaking of the ${foo}, it is now ${Date.now()}\`).  

## Vim commands
	- U = undo
	- V = highlight line 
	- d = cut highlighted line
	- y = copy highlighted line
	- P = paste before cursor 
	- $ = end of line
	- 0 = beginning of line
