In the node REPL mode (type `node`):
	
	- to clear the console: cmd + k
	
	- to show all available constructors/methods: double tab
	
	- double tap can be done at many points:

	- for example type `os.`, double tab to see all available methods.

	- the underscore variable is a stand-in for the last in-memory in the REPL:

		- >4+4
		- >8
		- >_+4
		- >12

	- To exit: ctrl + d
